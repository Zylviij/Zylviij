# Goals
  * Lightweight / Minimal (Syntax, Concepts, Features)
  * Safe (Compilation time checks vs runtime errors)
  * Fast
  * Practical (Can be used for many jobs, e.g. web development, application development, system development, robotics)
  * Community Drived (Curated by me, 2/5)

# Compilation
  * I like the idea of compiling to Java, C, and/or Javascript
    * I like Java because
      * Cross Platform / Identical Behavior
    * I like C because
      * Fast
      * Minimal
      * Embeded
    * I like JavaScript because
      * Web Development

# Project Structuring
  * I like the idea of Golang's packaging system
    * Github master branch is current stable branch
      * Backwards Compatibility is a MUST
    * Development branches 
  * Lightweight Testing
  * Ability to run a single file, but projects will likely be 

# Syntax

# Concurrency

# Garbage Collection
  * Scope Based (Kinda similar to rust)
    * Never more than one pointer to Data
    * No Pointer Arithmatic

# Data Structures
  * Array
    * All arrays are variable length
  * Map
    * similar to JSON Objects
  * List
    * Accessed like haskell lists

# Type System
  * Struct
  * Interface
  
  * Numbers
    * `int` -- an integer with size 32 bits
    * `integer` -- an integer with arbitrary precision (maximum of 2^32 bits or so)
    * `frac` -- a fractional representation of a rational number, numerator and denominator have arbitrary precision
    * `float` -- a decimal representation of a number with 64 bits of precision
  * Other
    * `bool` -- a boolean value
    * `string` -- utf8 encoded string of chars

# JavaScript
  * Node
    * Runs as a compiled program would expect to run
  * Browser
    * Runs on page load
